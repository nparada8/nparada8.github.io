               <h1> About </h1>
               <p> Natalie's Beach Grill, originally called The Shwack Beach Grill was opened by owner Max Fisher - who is a surfing aficionado - in 2011. Fisher wanted a beach theme for his restaurant and Dana Point was the perfect location.  This was Fisher's first restaurant as he was previously a general contractor. His only connection to the restaurant industry was via his father who is a long time corporate chef and owner of Cosmo's Italian Kitchen. Despite the lack of experience, Fisher wanted a place that sold good, natural foods, offered a large number of craft beers, and had the feel of a beach shack. He accomplished just that.</p>
               <p> It was not until 2020, when current owner Natalie Parada bought Schwack Beach Grill from Fisher so he can enjoy his retirement surfing all around the world. Parada changed the name to Natalie's Beach Grill after purchasing the restaurant. However, everything else about it remains the same. Natalie's Beach Grill has the same incredible service, tasty menu with real ingredients, and atmosphere that locals love. </p>
